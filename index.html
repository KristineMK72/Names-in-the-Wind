            <h1>The Silent Crisis: Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women</h1>
            <p>The MMIW crisis is a form of gender-based violence rooted in colonialism, where Indigenous women face homicide rates up to six times higher than non-Indigenous women. In the U.S., over 5,700 reports of missing Native women were logged in 2016 alone, yet many go underreported due to jurisdictional gaps on tribal lands. This isn't isolated—it's genocide, as declared by Canada's 2019 National Inquiry.</p>

            <p>Let's honor their stories by mapping the places they were last seen.</p>

            <h2>Historical Roots: From Colonialism to "Lands of Impunity"</h2>
            <p>Generations of trauma from residential schools and policies like the Major Crimes Act have created "lands of impunity" where non-Native perpetrators often evade justice—67% of assaults on Native women involve non-Native offenders. In Canada, the Highway of Tears (BC's Highway 16) has claimed at least 19 lives since 1969, many hitchhikers ignored by police.</p>

            <h2>Their Stories: Voices on the Map</h2>
            <p>Behind the stats are daughters, mothers, and warriors. Explore the map below for key cases.</p>
            <div id="map"></div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tina Fontaine, 15 (Winnipeg, Manitoba, 2014)</strong>: An Anishinaabe girl found in the Red River, wrapped in plastic—her death sparked "Drag the Red" searches. Last seen after child welfare involvement; killer acquitted despite evidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Olivia Lone Bear (North Dakota, 2017)</strong>: Blackfeet Nation member whose body was found in a submerged car nine months after vanishing. Ruled suspicious, but no arrests—family questions the investigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Stacy Hill, 17 (Red Lake Indian Reservation, Minnesota, 2009)</strong>: Ojibwe teen found murdered after a night out; case stalled due to limited resources on the rez.</li>
                <li><strong>Pepita Redhair, 27 (Albuquerque, New Mexico, 2020)</strong>: Navajo woman feared trafficked; last seen leaving a shelter. Family pleads for tips amid urban Indigenous vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Ashley Loring HeavyRunner (Blackfeet Nation, Montana, 2017)</strong>: Advocated for MMIW before disappearing; her case exposed FBI delays in rural searches.</li>
                <li><strong>Jermain Charlo (Missoula, Montana, 2018)</strong>: Salish woman vanished after a night out; podcast "Stolen" details cross-jurisdictional hurdles.</li>
                <li><strong>Highway of Tears (British Columbia, Canada)</strong>: A 719-km corridor where at least 18 Indigenous women have been murdered or gone missing since 1969.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>For more cases, draw from CBC's Case Explorer (250+ unsolved in Canada) or BIA lists.</em></p>

            <h2>Call to Action: Healing and Change</h2>
            <p>Support starts locally: Contact the Missing and Murdered Unit (BIA) or join marches like Walk 4 Justice. Demand better data via Savanna's Act and amplify #MMIW. Resources: <a href="https://www.uihi.org/mmiw-database-overview/" target="_blank">UIHI Database</a> for U.S. cases; <a href="https://www.nwac.ca/" target="_blank">NWAC</a> for Canada.</p>
