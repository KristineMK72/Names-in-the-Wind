## Overview: Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Relatives (MMIWG2S+)

The crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW), also called Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Relatives (MMIWR / MMIWG2S+) or Missing and Murdered Indigenous People (MMIP), affects Indigenous communities across North America, including the United States and Canada.

### Why “complete lists” are hard
A truly complete public list is not possible because cases are underreported and inconsistently recorded, and because of systemic barriers such as jurisdictional complexity (tribal/state/federal), racial misclassification, and uneven data collection. The Sovereign Bodies Institute (SBI) notes its MMIP Database logs cases across all genders and ages from 1900 to present, but it is not exhaustive. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### Key statistics (high-level)
- In the U.S., Native women face murder rates “more than 10 times the national average” in some areas, and homicide is among the leading causes of death for AI/AN girls and young women. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- In 2016, NCIC recorded 5,712 reports of missing American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls; far fewer were reflected in major federal databases used for public-facing searches. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- In Canada, Indigenous women account for a disproportionate share of female homicide victims; Government of Canada reporting notes 16% of police-reported female homicide victims (1980–2014) were Indigenous. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- UIHI’s 2018 urban study identified 506 cases across 71 cities (a subset shaped by available records, not a full count). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
